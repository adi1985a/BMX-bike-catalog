## üìÑ Overview

**BMX Katalog Produkt√≥w** (BMX Product Catalog), developed by Adrian Lesniak (Index: 154256), is a static website built using HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript, designed to showcase a range of BMX bicycles. The site features an engaging hero section with a background image and introductory text, a clear product listing displaying five different BMX bikes with their images and prices, and a top navigation bar. All content and navigational elements are presented in Polish. While primarily static, it includes `main.js` for potential future interactivity.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   üåÑ **Hero Section**:
    *   Prominently displays a large background image (`background-image.jpg`) with a semi-transparent overlay for text readability.
    *   Features a catchy title (e.g., "Ratownicy na dw√≥ch k√≥≈Çkach" - Rescuers on two wheels) and introductory text about BMX bikes.
*   üö≤ **Product Listing**:
    *   Showcases a static list of five BMX bikes.
    *   Each product entry includes:
        *   An image of the bike (e.g., `bmx1.jpg` to `bmx5.jpg`).
        *   The bike's name or model.
        *   Its price (e.g., "$249.99" ‚Äì "$349.99").
*   üß≠ **Navigation Menu**:
    *   Provides links to different sections/pages (currently placeholders):
        *   Produkty (Products - likely linking to the main product section or `index.html`)
        *   Dodaj Produkt (Add Product - e.g., `add_product.html`)
        *   Edytuj Produkt (Edit Product - e.g., `edit_product.html`)
        *   Login (e.g., `login.html`)
*   ü¶∂ **Footer**:
    *   Includes author information: Adrian Lesniak, Index: 154256.
*   üì± **Responsive Design Considerations**:
    *   Uses `styles.css` for styling, which should ideally include responsive design rules (e.g., media queries).
    *   Includes the viewport meta tag (`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`) for better compatibility on mobile devices.
*   üáµüá± **Polish Language Content**:
    *   All user-facing text, including titles, descriptions, navigation labels, and product information, is in Polish (e.g., "Katalog produkt√≥w"). The HTML document is marked with `lang="pl"`.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **JavaScript Inclusion**:
    *   Links to `main.js`, indicating potential for client-side interactivity (though specific functionalities are not detailed in the overview).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack & Requirements

### Core Technologies:
*   **Structure**: HTML5
*   **Styling**: CSS3 (`styles.css`)
*   **Interactivity (Potential)**: JavaScript (`main.js`)

### Requirements:
*   **Web Browser**: Any modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge).
*   **Local Assets**: All specified CSS, JavaScript, and image files must be present in the correct locations relative to `index.html`.
    *   `styles.css` (root directory or linked path)
    *   `main.js` (root directory or linked path)
    *   `background-image.jpg` (path as specified in CSS/HTML)
    *   `bmx1.jpg`, `bmx2.jpg`, `bmx3.jpg`, `bmx4.jpg`, `bmx5.jpg` (paths as specified in HTML)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Setup & Viewing

1.  **Clone or Download the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory> 
    ```
    *(Replace `<repository-url>` and `<repository-directory>` with your specific details, or simply download the files into a local folder).*

2.  **Ensure Asset Placement**:
    *   Verify that `styles.css` and `main.js` are in the same directory as `index.html` (or update paths in `index.html` if they are in subfolders like `css/` or `js/`).
    *   Ensure `background-image.jpg` and all `bmx*.jpg` product images are present and their paths in the HTML/CSS are correct. Often, images are placed in an `images/` or `img/` subfolder.

3.  **Open in Browser or Host Locally**:
    *   **Directly in Browser**: You can usually open `index.html` directly in your web browser (File > Open File).
    *   **Using a Simple HTTP Server (Recommended for proper asset loading and JS behavior)**:
        If you have Python installed, navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run:
        ```bash
        python -m http.server 8000
        ```
        Then, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.
    *   Alternatively, use any other local web server solution (e.g., Live Server extension in VS Code, XAMPP/MAMP htdocs).

## üí° Website Usage & Navigation

1.  Open `index.html` in your web browser using one of the methods described above.
2.  **Interface**:
    *   **Header**: Displays the website title/logo and the main navigation links (Produkty, Dodaj Produkt, Edytuj Produkt, Login).
    *   **Hero Section**: Features a prominent background image with an overlay, the main title (e.g., "Ratownicy na dw√≥ch k√≥≈Çkach"), and a brief description related to BMX bikes.
    *   **Product List**: Shows a grid or list of five BMX bikes, each with its image and price.
    *   **Footer**: Contains author information (Adrian Lesniak, 154256).
3.  **Actions**:
    *   **View Products**: Scroll through the product list to see the available BMX bikes.
    *   **Navigation**: Click on the navigation links:
        *   "Produkty" will likely reload or scroll to the product section on `index.html`.
        *   "Dodaj Produkt," "Edytuj Produkt," and "Login" are currently **placeholders** and will attempt to navigate to corresponding HTML files (e.g., `add_product.html`, `login.html`). These pages would need to be created separately.
    *   Any interactive features (e.g., image sliders, dynamic content loading) would depend on the implementation within `main.js` (which is unspecified in the overview).

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure

The project is expected to have the following basic file structure:

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure for the hero section, product list, navigation, and footer.
*   `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling all elements of the website.
*   `main.js`: The JavaScript file for any client-side interactivity.
*   `background-image.jpg`: The image used for the hero section background.
*   `bmx1.jpg`, `bmx2.jpg`, `bmx3.jpg`, `bmx4.jpg`, `bmx5.jpg`: Images for the individual BMX products.
*   (Potentially) Placeholder HTML files like `products.html`, `add_product.html`, `edit_product.html`, `login.html`.
*   `README.md`: This documentation file.

*(It's common practice to organize CSS, JS, and images into subfolders like `css/`, `js/`, and `img/` or `assets/img/` for better project structure. If so, paths in `index.html` must reflect this.)*

## üìù Important Notes & Considerations

*   **Polish Language**: The website content and UI text are in Polish (`lang="pl"` is set in the HTML).
*   **Placeholder Navigation**: Links in the navigation bar (for adding/editing products, login) point to HTML files that are currently placeholders. These pages would need to be created and implemented for full functionality.
*   **Image Paths**: Correct paths to `background-image.jpg` and all `bmx*.jpg` files are crucial for them to display. The inline style for the hero background image (`style="background-image: url('background-image.jpg');"`) assumes the image is in the same directory as `index.html` unless a different path is specified.
*   **`main.js` Functionality**: The specific interactive features provided by `main.js` are not detailed. This file would need to be implemented to add any dynamic behavior.
*   **Static Nature**: This is a static website. Features like adding, editing, or logging in would require a backend system (e.g., using PHP, Node.js, Python/Django/Flask, Laravel) and a database.
*   **`styles.css` Implementation**: The quality of the visual design and responsiveness depends heavily on the content of `styles.css`, which is assumed to be provided but not detailed.
