## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure

The project is expected to have the following basic file structure:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure for the hero section, product list, navigation, and footer.  
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling all elements of the website.  
- `main.js`: The JavaScript file for any client-side interactivity.  
- `background-image.jpg`: The image used for the hero section background.  
- `bmx1.jpg`, `bmx2.jpg`, `bmx3.jpg`, `bmx4.jpg`, `bmx5.jpg`: Images for the individual BMX products.

## üìù Important Notes & Considerations

- **Dynamic Features**: The product list and search functionality are powered by JavaScript.  
- **Static Nature**: This is a static website. Features like adding, editing, or logging in would require a backend system.
